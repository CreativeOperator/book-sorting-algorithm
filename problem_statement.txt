Problem Statement:
The goal is to develop a new book-sorting algorithm that improves efficiency and accuracy in organizing books. The algorithm should handle various sorting criteria such as author, title, and genre.

Potential Solutions:
1. Implement a hybrid sorting algorithm that combines quicksort and mergesort.
2. Utilize machine learning to predict sorting patterns and optimize the process.
3. Develop a parallel sorting algorithm to leverage multi-core processors.
