# Documentation

## Overview
This repository contains the implementation of a new book-sorting algorithm designed to improve efficiency and accuracy in organizing books. The algorithm is implemented in Python and includes test cases to validate its functionality.

## Files
- `problem_statement.txt`: Describes the problem statement and potential solutions.
- `algorithm_implementation.py`: Contains the Python code for the book-sorting algorithm.
- `test_cases.txt`: Provides test cases for validating the algorithm.

## Usage
To use the book-sorting algorithm, run the `algorithm_implementation.py` script with a list of books as input. The output will be a sorted list of books based on the specified criteria.
